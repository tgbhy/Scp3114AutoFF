# Scp3114AutoFF (SCP-3114 Auto Friendly Fire)
## Explanation
This plugin was asked by MarXen (markus123_) on the EXILED's Discord Server on 05/09/2025.

He asked a "Simple plugin. Whenever SCP-3114 is alive, friendly fire is automatically turned on, until either 3114 dies or round ends."
The plugin is setting FriendlyFire to false when the Round is Starting and setting it to true if any SCP-3114 is alive.

## Installation
- Download the latest `Scp3114AutoFF.dll` in [releases](https://github.com/tgbhy/Scp3114AutoFF/releases)
- Put the .dll file in your EXILED's plugins folder. (Mostly on `.config/EXILED/Plugins/`)
- Restart your server.
